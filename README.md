## Hemisu Theme for Airline

Created by [kokakolako](https://github.com/kokakolako) for
[`vim-airline`](https://github.com/bling/vim-airline), as a complement to Noah
Frederick awesome [`vim-hemisu`](https://github.com/noahfrederick/vim-hemisu)
colorscheme.

### How to install:

#### Vundle
Just add to your `.vimrc`:

```vim
 Plugin 'lsdr/vim-hemisu-airline'
```

#### Manually
Clone repository

```sh
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone https://github.com/lsdr/vim-airline-hemisu.git
```

#### Troubleshooting

`vim-airline` should correctly guess the name of the theme and apply it
_automagically_, requiring no extra conf.

If this does not happen, add `let g:airline_theme = 'hemisu'` to your `.vimrc`.
